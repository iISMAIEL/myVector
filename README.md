This repository represents An attempt to create a custom implementation of a resizable array, the Custom Resizable Array (CRA), in C++. It aims to provide an alternative to the standard std::vector class, offering similar functionality with potential advantages for specific use cases.

It was primarily created as an exercise to learn C++ technicalities. ( PPP book "Third Edition" )
